# JavaScript-Quiz
This repository contains the code for an interactive JavaScript quiz. 


The interactive JavaScript quiz is a timed 4 question multiple-choice assesment. When the user starts the quiz, the 20 second timer will start. If the user answers a question correctly, their score will increase by 100 points. If the user answers a question incorrectly, then they will lose 5 seconds form the remaining quiz time. The game will end when all the questions have been answered or when the timer reaches 0. The user can then input their initials to save their score. Their score will then be displayed on the leader-board.
